# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm
Implementation of Genetic Algorithm in Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

1. Introduction:
The aim of the project was to create a computer application utilizing a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The application was designed to find the optimal route visiting each city exactly once and returning to the starting city, minimizing the total distance traveled.

2. Problem Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city from a specified list exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is an NP-hard optimization problem.
